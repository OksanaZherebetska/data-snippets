-- ðŸŽ¯ GOAL:
-- Find out what product categories are ordered together â€” is Hair flying solo or hanging out with Skin?
-- Categorize orders by their category mix to analyze bundling behavior at order level.

DECLARE brand_keys ARRAY<INT64>;  -- Brand(s) to analyze
DECLARE business_unit STRING;     -- Business unit (e.g., 'CORE', 'US')
DECLARE start_date DATE;
DECLARE end_date DATE;

-- Analyze from Jan 1st to yesterday
SET start_date = DATE_TRUNC(CURRENT_DATE(), YEAR);
SET end_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
SET brand_keys = [1234];  -- Replace with your brand keys
