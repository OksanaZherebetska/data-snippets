-- ðŸŽ¯ GOAL:
-- Calculate product-level metrics for bundles with cost allocation to child products.
-- Includes corrections for brand keys and mappings for bundle/child/product relationships.

-- ðŸ›  Parameters
DECLARE start_date DATE;
DECLARE end_date DATE;
DECLARE start_date_pre DATE;
DECLARE end_date_pre DATE;

SET start_date = DATE_ADD(DATE_SUB(DATE_TRUNC(CURRENT_DATE(), MONTH), INTERVAL 1 DAY), INTERVAL -1 YEAR);
SET end_date = DATE_SUB(DATE_TRUNC(CURRENT_DATE(), MONTH), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
SET start_date_pre = DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL -1 YEAR);
SET end_date_pre = DATE_ADD(end_date, INTERVAL -1 YEAR);
