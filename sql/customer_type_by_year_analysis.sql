-- ðŸŽ¯ GOAL:
-- Segment customers by type based on their order frequency across years.
-- Distinguish between one-time buyers, consistently infrequent buyers, and everyone else.

-- ðŸ§® PARAMETERS

DECLARE end_date DATE;
DECLARE brand_keys ARRAY<INT64>;

-- Analyze two past years (adjustable)

-- Define brand filter
