-- üß† PRICE COMPLIANCE CHECKER
-- Core goal: track how long products stay discounted, compare it to regular price periods, and flag non-compliant behavior.
-- Translation: are we respecting RRP, or is this another permanent "campaign"?

-- üìÜ STEP 0: Define time range (last 16 days) & purge existing records
